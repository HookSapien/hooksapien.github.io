      <p>Do websites actually increase revenue?
        Though times are changing, one thing about businesses never change. Trust. People buy from whom they trust. Most of the businesses thrive because they build trust. And you need to use all the methods to build trust you can.
        Websites build trust. Having a website signifies you are an established business. Being on a site feels a lot like being in a brick and mortar shop, a supermarket, or a company headquarters. You can see the different products and services offered. You can see the different navigational directions placed. You can see the whole shop, with its curves and corners. And let me tell you. People love going to supermarkets. This connects your business with your customers and helps them trust you.
        It is scientifically proven that we remember experience more than anything. So when someone browses your website as e-shop/company-headquarters, they remember the experience. And if you are able to please them there, you become their number one destination to do business with.
        Websites are your number one source of establishing rapport. You can’t control any other site/marketing platform as you can do your site. I’m not saying lie. I’m saying here you can highlight your work, your value and show them what you offer.
        Nowadays, whenever we want something, we first search the web. And often find what we need there only. Suppose you are in the real estate industry. When someone wants to sell their house in California, where you live. Where will they go? Most often the internet. And when they find your “we buy houses in California” sign on the internet, they will definitely contact you first. That kind of instant dealing was not possible in the past. This is true for every profession and business. Be it lawyers, restaurants, small businesses, home-made product e-retailers. Almost everyone can profit from this kind of interaction. 
        In this age, businesses thrive by looking after their customers. People today “want genuine experience”, more than anything in a business. The customers in turn expect you to look after them. And when people search for your site on their number one source of information – internet, and they don’t find you, what will happen to the trust? When people don’t find something where they expect it to be, they become disappointed. They blame the business of not making it easier for its clients to interact. And while one business takes the blame, another business will come up on their search, with which they will do the business.
        Most important fact is that Website is a form of advertisement. And an important one in that. When people search for your business and find it where they think it’s supposed to be, they are pleased. When your site convinces them that you can help, which is not that hard, and that you can provide value, they start trusting you. When people trust you, they do business with you. When they are satisfied with your business they become loyal. When they become loyal, they come back with more business. And they also share the word. The seemingly small change of showing up on their search snowballs, and in time increases revenues exponentially. 
        
        Disclaimer: All of the above information are true to the best of my knowledge. And I acknowledge that they can be wrong. Proceed at your own caution.
