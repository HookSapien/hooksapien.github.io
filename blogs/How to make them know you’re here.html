      <p>How to make them know you’re here

        Hi! This is HookSapien, and today we’re going to talk about your business.
        Have you ever wondered why business is not as impactful, as you expected it to be? Have you ever wanted to grow your real estate business to such a level, that you are the first name anyone speaks of, when real estate deals are required? I hope you have. Because, that desire to grow is what catalyzes almost every successful business.
        I studied many businesses during my observations. Some thrived and are growing rapidly, while there are others, even the names of which are forgotten. But what struck me the most was that, almost all of the failed business had some things in common. Here I’ll list my observations and explain them, in the hope that you won’t repeat them, and we as a whole continue to grow.
        1.	Approachability: how approachable are you? No, I’m not talking about your personality. What I’m asking is that whether if someone in your real estate farm/locality wanted to buy/sell a property, would you be the first person they contact? Or, would you even be contacted within two hours of them making the decision? Probably not. Most of the real estate investors are told about a new deal after a few days, if they are even told. And that’s when small business closes. Call it laziness, inefficiency in time management, fault of your realtor, or anything else. It doesn’t matter. You still lost the deal. And guess what. You can’t change someone else. What if the faults are with the opposition? You can’t change every new client you find. You must find a more efficient way of being approached. Read the entire article to find the number one and most obvious, but so often ignored solution.
        2.	Credibility: suppose people still find you. Their realtor talks very highly of you. He tells them of your achievements and your effective offers. But, not all of them actually believe the realtor’s words. I believe Human nature is doubtful, which was necessary for our survival in the prehistoric times. Furthermore, the realtor talks highly of every person, as long as he is making a commission out of the sale. Why would the people believe that you would actually buy their/sell them property? What you need is a place where your potential clients can check work and believe in your skills. That way, you will almost always have the upper hand during negotiations, as they know you’re not bluffing, and can actually deliver what was asked.
        3.	Skills: closely related to credibility is skills. But most people don’t realize this. They think good reputation comes just from more work and advertisements, along with some other activities. Wrong. If you want to be successful, you must the skills required to do it. Built your skills well, and you reach one step closer to more clients.
        
        
        
        Disclaimer: All of the above information are true to the best of my knowledge. And I acknowledge that they can be wrong. Proceed at your own caution.
